    <p>After completing this coding assignment, I really only found one aspect of it difficult. After a day or two of being puzzled, I realized that my injected css style sheets did not match in their name in my file source. So, when very few things in my css were working, it made the assingnment nearly impossible. Stopping and double checking everything was extremely useful becuase I found all of my syntactic errors, fixed them, and completed the assingment a whole lot faster. I found that the skeleton framework was pretty interesting and flexible to use and I would definitely use it again for its ease of use. I don't think I learned any new techniques (besides the lessons from class), but I have been more confident in using older techniques that have sped up my workflow. When trying to get my nav the right size I was constantly deleting and adding values to get what I wanted. I think my site is very basic looking, but functions well. So, I would defnitely would want to improve its visual appeal. I don't like how the site looks very flat like it's on paper. I could try adding more CSS that would make it pop off the page, rather than keeping my CSS more simple and basic. </p>
